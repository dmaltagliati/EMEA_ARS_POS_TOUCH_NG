   Proposal of partial (= line based) support of Arabic text.
   ----------------------------------------------------------

   Arabic text will be supported on line-level only.
   A line consists of 40 characters based on Cp1256 in the flat files.
   The full bi-directional support of the JVM is applied for graphic rendering.

   Arabic text-fields cannot be put into lines with numbers or English text.
   The re-ordering of fields with different run-directions,
   in conjunction with various contextualisation features applied,
   would certainly destroy the structure of receipt and report data lines.


   Features to be delivered:
   
   - Graphical line data printed on thermal receipt paper
   - Arabic text lines (Cp1256) in electronic receipt file
   
   - Arabic text lines in a new file for 2nd language support,
     printed left-aligned before the structured English line.

     Record layout like P_REGPAR, P_REGTXT, etc.
     file name = P_REGDBL.DAT, record size=50,
     file type = binary lookup (sorted), keysize=7

     CHDRx:Receipt.Header..........................

   - Arabic PLU text in auxiliary PLU record (type E).

   
   Features not supported:

   - Arabisation of the operator interface (GUI, operator display)
   - JavaPos output of Arabic text to character-level devices
     (the committee specified UniCode, so it is up to JavaPos
      to provide bi-directional language support)
   - direct output of Arabic text to any device based on oem character sets
   - Arabic text in sales data files (ACT, DPT, REG, SLM)
   - Arabic text fields in any lookup file except PLU record type E
   - Arabic text in any parameter file, unless it is a complete printline.
