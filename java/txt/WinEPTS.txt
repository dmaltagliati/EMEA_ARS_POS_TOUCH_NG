protocol headers (N5P5) partly unclear / not used
-------------------------------------------------
details:
NNNNN = node (probably senseless in interface between PoS appl and WinEPTS client)
PPPPP = port (which one, PoS appl or WinEPTS client ?)
        neither one is necessary, all datagrams carry both ports anyway.
GGG   = virtual EFT terminal id (probably senseless in interface between PoS appl and WinEPTS client)


data message formats partly unclear / not specified
---------------------------------------------------
details:
- some 1-byte fields hold numeric info, binary (0x00-0xff) or ASCII (0x30-0x39) is not specified.
- various ASCII strings hold 1-byte character sets, IBM/DOS (oem) or ANSI (Latin-1) is not specified.
- crc is said to be "performed on the whole message", is N5P5 header and var.length included ?
- max. message size missing in specification:
  C-code sample shows MsgIn/MsgOut sizes of 256 bytes each,
  whereas Receipt-Data message has upto 512b receipt data plus 512b extra data ?


data message contents do not match with PoS framework 
-----------------------------------------------------
print-line issues:
- line-size of receipt data not specified.
- how to print doublewide ?

properties of modal dialogues inconsistent or not supported:
- extended error message too large for 2x20.
- getString prompt in multiple lines on 2x20 ?
- answer upto 64 characters not supported.
- choices can be aborted, getString cannot ?

referral number (for void) cannot be xfered in authorization request
- PoS appl requests this input before EFT transaction starts

end-of-day command missing (generation change):
- PoS supports terminal shut-down before store EoD
